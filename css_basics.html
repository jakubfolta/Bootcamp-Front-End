            <h1>My Lovely Cat Bob</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Bob is a stunning cat, especially considering that when she came into our lives she only weighed five pounds and had lost much of her fur. She is rather meticulous about her appearance as well and continually grooms herself, keeping her fur luxe and her toe-tufts reasonably white. She also looks smashing in a floppy bowtie. Since she has become an outdoor cat she has gotten some sun highlights in her black fur, but this does not detract from her beauty.</p>
            <h2>Bob`s favorite toy</h2>
            <p>It is no secret that cats love boxes! The best thing about using boxes is they are usually free and come in a wide variety of sizes. Discard or recycle old ones after he becomes bored with them and replace with new sizes periodically. You can turn them upside down and cut an entrance "hole" in them and "windows" for a fun little cathouse. There are many possibilities and ways you can get creative and use boxes to entertain your cat! Caution: use supervision when letting your cats play in boxes that may still be filled with packing peanuts because there is always the risk he could eat or choke on them.</p>
